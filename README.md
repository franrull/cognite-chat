# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Launch

Run `yarn install` followed by `yarn start` to start the project on http://localhost:3000/

## Details

- Avatars are generated randomly (just for fun :D) based on their ID in turn is generated using a UUID npm library
- Hit `ENTER` while typing a message to send it
- The app works best for resolutions > 800px 
- I tried to split into single components most of the blocks of the app. With more time, it could be improved.
